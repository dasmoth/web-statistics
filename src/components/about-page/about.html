<p>As with many open source projects, this site makes use of a number of excellent tools and libraries, in

<p>Finally, this was inspired by a conversation with Dr Nicola Smyllie (<a href="https://twitter.com/NicolaSmyllie">@NicolaSmyllie</a>)
    who was annoyed at not being able to run some basic stats without installing expensive Windows-only software. This
    seemed like a sad state of affairs so I hacked something up before breakfast which did the job well enough. Another
    few hours turned it into what you see here. </p>
